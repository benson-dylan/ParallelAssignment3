<h2>Birthday Presents</h2>
<p>To solve this problem I created a concurrent linked list (singularly linked) to act as the "chain" described in the problem. It includes only the functionality required to solve the problem and inserts in numerical order. Items are only removed from the head which is an O(1) operation. To handle the "giftbad" and ensure that all the thank you cards have been written I used synchronized HashSets (shuffled for randomness). The giftbag set was filled with 500000 integers to represent the presents, then one of the three described tasks would occur at random. When a present would be removed from the set it would be added to the linked list, from there it would be removed from the front of the list and added to the card set to symbolize a card being written for that gift. Once the card set reached 500000 all the presents have been accounted for.<br>Since the method involves an amount of randomness execution times can vary but, without printing, average run time was 30 seconds on my machine. With printing I was hitting up to 200 seconds</p>
